# Mark as Done (Chrome Extension)

> Mark any page as Done. All the links to that page will be automatically marked with an icon and colored.
> This helps you keep track of your reading progress of large documentations or books.

For example, the following shows a partially read website, with some links marked as done. 

 ![](images/example.png) 

With one click the page is marked as TODO: 

![](docs/screenshot-todo.png)

And then it's easy to mark it as done:
